# Maptober! 30 day challenge in OpenStreetMap!

Are you ready for the world mapping challenge? For thirty one days we will work together to add new data to OpenStreetMap and create a better map for everyone!

## How it works.

1. Complete the task from the list by adding new objects such as roads, buildings, parks or stores. It's easy!
2. Show off your edits on social media using the hashtag #mapktober and with any other from the list.
3. Repeat it every day throughout October.

## Why it's worth it.

* Show the world that you are an OSM editor!
* Test your skills!
* You can learn to use new tools
* Gain new skills while helping others!
 
The idea is to improve OpenStreetMap data on a daily basis to the extent included in the daily task prepared for each day of October using the hashtag #Maptober in the description of the set of changes. And publishing a link to your set of changes with the same hashtag on any social media.

hastags list for Social Media:
* #maptober (mandatory)
* #maptober2024 (optional)
* #OsmEditChallenge (optional)
* #OpenStreetMap (optional)
* #MapWithPassion (optional)

We are launching on **01/10/2024!** Join our community and start mapping the world with us.
